Recently, I have took a test conducted by ISAC Centre of Excellence and there I came to understand that, the sequence changes with the level of vulnerabilities and threats,
considering how dangerous the threat could be for those vulnerabilities.

**OWASP Top 10 2017**
  1) **Injection**
  2) **Broken Authentication**
  3) **Sensitive Data Exposure**
  4) **XML External Entities(XEE)**
  5) **Broken Access Control**
  6) **Security Misconfiguration**
  7) **Cross Site Scripting(XSS)**
  8) **Insecure Deserialization**
  9) **Using Components with Unknown Vulnerabilities**
  10) **Insufficient Logging and Monitoring**

**OWASP Top 10 2021**
  1) **Broken Access Control**
  2) **Cryptographic Failure** --> Previously known as "**Sensitive Data Exposure**".
  3) **Injection**
  4) **Insecure Design**(NEW)
  5) **Security Misconfiguration**
  6) **Vulnerable and Outdated Components** --> Previously known as "**Using Components with Unknown Vulnerabilities**".
  7) **Identification and Authentication Failures** --> Previously known as "**Broken Authentication**".
  8) **Software and Data Integrity Failure**(NEW)
  9) **Security Logging and Monitoring Failure** --> Previous;y known as "**Insufficient Logging and Monitoring**".
  10) **Server-Side Request Frogery(SSRF)**(NEW)
